Adult Literacy is a dynamic, challenging and constantly developing field that helps adults reach their full potential. As your regional support organization, we want all practitioners to become fully aware of all aspects of the adult literacy field in Ontario. These aspects form the context for your work with adult students in your program. This presentation will provide you with an overview of the field and the LBS system that you work within. It is a helpful orientation for any staff or volunteers. It is also helpful to groups or agencies in the community that have questions about the LBS system. (58 slides) (Free download)
