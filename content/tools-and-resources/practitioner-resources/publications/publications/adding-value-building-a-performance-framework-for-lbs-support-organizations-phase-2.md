The purpose of Adding Value: Building a Performance Framework – Phase 2 was to provide the Literacy and Basic Skills support organizations in Ontario with information, training and tools that would allow them to increase their knowledge of performance management concepts. Increasing support organizations’ knowledge and use of performance management concepts is one approach to strengthening their capacity to support the programs and organizations that deliver literacy upgrading services to adult learners in Ontario. Phase 2 project built upon the program service logic models developed during Phase 1 by focusing on the performance measurement aspect of continuous improvement. Performance measurement describes how resources are being used (efficiency), how the work being done contributes to the achievement of stated outcomes (effectiveness) and whether or not the organizations’ “customers”—delivery agencies and other stakeholders—are satisfied with the results.
