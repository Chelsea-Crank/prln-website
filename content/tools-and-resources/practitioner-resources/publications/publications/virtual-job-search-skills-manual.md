The Workforce Planning Board of Waterloo Wellington Dufferin partnered with Project READ Literacy Network Waterloo-Wellington and Peel-Halton-Dufferin Adult Learning Network for this project.  HR & Recruitment personnel from different industries were invited to provide insight into the skills they are looking for jobseekers to demonstrate at different stages of the recruitment process.  

With the data collected, we created profiles defining the different job search tasks along with the skill level needed.  These profiles aim to clearly identify skill gaps and training opportunities for jobseekers, students and immigrants, so they can work on those skills and improve their success in their job search.  These profiles will also help the Job Developers, employment support workers, and organization to identify the skills required for a smooth and successful recruitment process in the changing labour market, providing them an opportunity to focus on problem points and enhancing employment support.
