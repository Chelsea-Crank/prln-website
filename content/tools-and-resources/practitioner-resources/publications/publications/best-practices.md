This project was conceived as a means to share best practices – in other words, all the good ideas – between community-based literacy agencies in the Western Region of Ontario tasked with continuing to deliver literacy programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. These agencies set out to pivot to remote or online learning to continue to serve learners who were often at the lowest learning levels, with the increased challenges of reduced fundraising dollars, and the smallest numbers of staff to meet the new challenges.
