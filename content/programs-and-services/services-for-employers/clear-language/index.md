### What is “Clear Language”?  

</summary>

Clear or Plain Language is a method of presenting information so it is easy for everyone to read and understand.  

- It considers how the document looks as well as what it says.  
- It aids comprehension and understanding.  
- It is focused on the reader not the writer.  
- It is logical and well-planned.  
- It is useful for conveying any message in any medium. 
  
Clear Language means your reader never has to say – “Huh?!”
